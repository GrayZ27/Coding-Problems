This repository contains my Swift solutions for Coding problems, and ideas on how to solve them.

These problems are mostly from LeetCode, some of them might from Hacker Rank, or other online resources, or solutions to solve some fun math problems. 

For the problems for LeetCode and other coding websites, I will post their original links with each problem name below, so you can easily go to that original problem for more examples and use their online compiler to test your own code. 

In each solution, I will use at least one case inside my swift file to test the solution. For more test cases to test your code, please follow the link and go to the original link for that problem.
